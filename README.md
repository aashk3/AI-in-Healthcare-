AI for Healthcare: AI-Based Health Risk Prediction Model
Exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare through predictive analytics.

This project simulates a synthetic patient dataset and applies basic data science techniques to assess individual health risks based on clinical features. It serves as a foundation for building more advanced models in healthcare risk prediction and patient stratification.

- Project Overview
  
The model:

Generates synthetic patient health data using Python

Calculates a risk score using weighted clinical features

Categorizes patients into Low, Medium, or High risk

Demonstrates practical healthcare analytics using pandas and NumPy

- Features Considered
  
Age

Gender

Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Smoking Status

Family History of Diabetes

BMI (Body Mass Index)

- Risk Score Logic
  
A weighted formula aggregates the patient's vitals and lifestyle features to compute a scaled Risk Score (0–100). Based on the score:

< 40 → Low Risk

40–69 → Medium Risk

70+ → High Risk

- Files Included
  
health_risk_prediction.ipynb – Main notebook containing all code

patient_data.csv – Synthetic dataset generated for the model

Visual outputs

- Tools & Libraries Used
  
Python 3

Google Colab

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for optional visualizations)

- Next Steps
  
Incorporate machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Add data visualization and risk factor correlation analysis

- Project Relevance
